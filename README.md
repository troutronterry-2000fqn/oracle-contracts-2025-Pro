## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. This is an excellent question that gets to the heart of how decentralized finance (DeFi) and centralized finance (CeFi) can interact.

Here‚Äôs a detailed description of how **oracle-contracts** integrate with major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken for automated trading and portfolio management.
